texs-ui-j2me
============

A Canvas based j2me framework inspired by BBOS APIs

This UI attempts to be a highly responsive interface for J2ME devices where you can create simple and complex objects.
It is entirely based on Canvas and 

1. Stretchable images / "9 patch" images
2. low library size, about 100KB.
3. Data management with methods for json parsing
4. High performance & memory management
5. No vendor lock-in!
6. Robust libraries for networking, string manipulation, etc.

The framework is currently in alpha stage and the first app is being deployed, which caters for touch devices, the non touch version is being tested at the moment, but is still very buggy.

Sample usage etc will be uploaded shortly
